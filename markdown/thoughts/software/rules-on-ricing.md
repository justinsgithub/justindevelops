# My Rules on "Ricing"

Don't waste too much time messing with your config files. It is too easy to get caught chasing the next shiny object which ends up being useless and not actually add any value to your workflow.

- set aside a certain amount of time per week that you think is reasonable for you to spend improving your config files.

- choose 1 or 2 days per week and a specific time during that day to edit your config files and give yourself the time cap you have allotted yourself (such as a Saturday morning).

- be disciplined and do not go over your time allotment, further changes can be done next week and it will give you time to think about the config changes that will actually provide you value.
